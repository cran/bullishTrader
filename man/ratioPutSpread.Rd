\description{
This strategy consists of a short position in NS close to ATM put options with a strike price X1L, and a long position in NL ITM put options with a strike price X2H, where NL is less than NS. Typically, NL is equal to 1 and NS is equal to 2, or NL is 2 and NS is 3. This is an income strategy if it is structured as a net credit trade. The traderâ€™s outlook is neutral to bullish (Kakushadze & Serur, 2018).
}
\details{
According to conceptual details given by Cohen (2015), and a closed form solution provided by Kakushadze and Serur (2018), this method is developed, and the given examples are created, to compute per share Profit and Loss at expiration and also the Breakeven (BE) point for Ratio Put Spread and draws its graph in the Plots tab.
